            <p>Welcome to expmotor!</p>
            <p>Expmotor is a web recruitment tool used to register participants for experiments run at the Centre for Experimental Research on Fairness, Inequality and Rationality, <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/">FAIR</a> at NHH.
                Expmotor was developed and is currently maintained by <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/erik-oiolf-sorensen/">Erik SÃ¸rensen</a> and <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/sebastian-fest2/">Sebastian Fest</a> at <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/">FAIR</a>, The Choice Lab.</p>
            <p>The software was originally written in php in 2007 by Erik and later ported to Python 2.5 using Django. This version of Expmotor was rewritten and modernized in 2021 by Sebastian. It is currently maintained by the Data Infrastrcuture Unit at <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/">FAIR</a>.</p>
            <p>If you wish to use expmotor as an administrator to recruit participants for your experiment, you may open up an account. We will usually approve your request within 48 hours. </p>
