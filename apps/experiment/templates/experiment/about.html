            <p>Expmotor was developed at FAIR by Erik SÃ¸rensen and Sebastian Fest to help register participants for
            Experiments at FAIR, The Choice Lab. Originally, the software was written in php in 2007 by Erik and later
            ported to Python 2.5 using Django. This version of Expmotor was rewritten by Sebastian using Django
            and Python 3.9</p>
