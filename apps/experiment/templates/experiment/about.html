            <p>Expmotor is a web recruitment tool used to register participants for experiments run at the Centre for
                Experimental Research on Fairness, Inequality and Rationality, <a
                        href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/">FAIR</a> at NHH. </p>
            <p>Expmotor was developed for the implementation of the international experiment "mmtk" in the spring of
                2007. Back then, it became relevant to invite possibly the entire Faculty of Social Sciences at the
                University of Oslo, and it would be too much for one individual to maintain email correspondence with so
                many. Erik Sørensen therefore hacked a simple interface to a database that enabled participants to
                register for sessions without interference from the research group. The first version of Expmotor was
                coded in PHP. This system worked, but it was somewhat primitive. It was used a couple of times at the
                Norwegian School of Economics (NHH), but also by Sigve Tjøtta and Gaute Torsvik at the University of
                Bergen (UiB). </p>
            <p>In the summer of 2009, Trond Halvorsen needed a small project to get into Python/Django programming. So
                he and Erik started a redesign of Expmotor for Python/Django. This was completed over the summer and has
                been in use for various experiments. Sigve Tjøtta has adopted this version, and Sandvik/Kobbeltvedt at
                NHH have also used Expmotor outside the core group.</p>
            <p>The current version of Expmotor was rewritten from scratch and given a modernized look in 2021 by <a
                    href="https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/sebastian-fest2/">Sebastian Fest</a>. It has been used since
                for many more projects by the research group but also externals such as Joel Berge and Aysil
                Emirmahmutoglu. It is currently maintained by
                the Data Infrastrcuture Unit at <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/">FAIR</a>.</p>
            <p>If you wish to use expmotor as an administrator to recruit participants for your experiment, you may open
                up an account. We will usually approve your request within 48 hours. </p>
